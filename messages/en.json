        "question": "Is the data from this size conversion tool accurate?",
        "answer": "Yes, our data is collected directly from official brand size charts. We regularly update our database to ensure conversion suggestions match official standards, helping you reduce the risk of returns."

      {
        "question": "Which country and region sizing standards do you support?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Why do suggested sizes sometimes differ between brands?",
        "answer": "Because different brands (or even different series within the same brand) use different lasts or cutting processes. Our tool considers these brand differences to provide more precise comparisons rather than simple mathematical conversions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if my measurement falls between two sizes?",
        "answer": "It is generally recommended to follow the 'size up' rule and choose the size that is half a size larger for better comfort. Especially for sneakers or winter boots, having a little extra room is better."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this tool free to use?",
        "answer": "Completely free. We are committed to providing convenient tools; you can use all conversion and comparison features without registering or paying any fees."
